        He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the
        unexplained creations of humankind that showed the wonder of our
        ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian
        pyramids. Thereâ€™s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly
        discovered monument that simply didn't make any sense and he wondered
        how he was ever going to be able to explain it.

        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
        their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
        idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
        forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
        writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of
        a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
        paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
        have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
        matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
        use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.

        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
        routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to
        try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose
        here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes
        onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their
        fingers.
